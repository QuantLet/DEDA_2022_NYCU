america against all dangers we will lead america into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement we will rekindle new faith in our values new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our country because we understand that america is not a land cloaked in darkness america is the torch that enlightens the entire worldgathered here at our beautiful and majestic white house – known all over the world as the peoples house – we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great american story this has been the home of largerthanlife figures like teddy roosevelt and andrew jackson who rallied americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future within these walls lived tenacious generals like presidents grant and eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom from these grounds thomas jefferson sent lewis and clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent in the depths of a bloody civil war president abraham lincoln looked out these very windows upon a halfcompleted washington monument – and asked god in his providence to save our union two weeks after pearl harbor franklin delano roosevelt welcomed winston churchill and just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the second world warin recent months our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy like those brave americans before us we are meeting this challenge we are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner! we will defeat the virus end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever beforewhat united generations past was an unshakable confidence in americas destiny and an unbreakable faith in the american people they knew that our country is blessed by god and has a special purpose in this world it is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union our westward expansion the abolition of slavery the passage of civil rights the space program and the overthrow of fascism tyranny and communismthis towering american spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavorand yet despite all of our greatness as a nation everything we have achieved is now endangered this is the most important election in the history of our country at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendasthis election will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destinyit will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decadesyour vote will decide whether we protect law abiding americans or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists agitators and criminals who threaten our citizensand this election will decide whether we will defend the american way of life or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy itat the democrat national convention joe biden and his party repeatedly assailed america as a land of racial economic and social injustice so tonight i ask you a very simple question: how can the democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?in the lefts backward view they do not see america as the most free just and exceptional nation on earth instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sinsour opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them this is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout historybut in this country we dont look to career politicians for salvation in america we dont turn to government to restore our souls – we put our faith in almighty godjoe biden is not the savior of americas soul – he is the destroyer of americas jobs and if given the chance he will be the destroyer of american greatnessfor 47 years joe biden took the donations of blue collar workers gave them hugs and even kisses and told them he felt their pain – and then he flew back to washington and voted to ship their jobs to china and many other distant lands joe biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of american workers offshoring their jobs opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign warsfour years ago i ran for president because i could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer i could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade borders foreign policy and national defense our nato partners as an example were far behind in their defense payments but at my strong urging they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year this will ultimately go to $400 billion secretary general stoltenberg who heads nato was amazed and said that president trump did what no one else was able to dofrom the moment i left my former life behind and a good life it was i have done nothing but fight for youi did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of washington politics i kept my promisestogether we have ended the rule of the failed political class – and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary they are angry at me because instead of putting them first i put america first!days after taking office we shocked the washington establishment and withdrew from the last administrations jobkilling trans pacific partnership i then approved the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines ended the unfair and costly paris climate accord and secured for the first time american energy independence we passed recordsetting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before within three short years we built the strongest economy in the history of the worldwashington insiders asked me not to stand up to china – they pleaded with me to let china continue stealing our jobs ripping us off and robbing our country blind but i kept my word to the american people we took the toughest boldest strongest and hardest hitting action against china in american historythey said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace nafta – but again they were wrong earlier this year i ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new us mexico canada agreement into law now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in america not firing their employees and deserting usin perhaps no area did the washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of proamerican immigration but i refused to back down – and today americas borders are more secure than ever before we ended catchandrelease stopped asylum fraud took down human traffickers who prey on women and children and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens we have already built 300 miles of border wall – and we are adding 10 new miles every single week the wall will soon be complete and it is working beyond our wildest expectationswe are joined this evening by members of the border patrol union representing our countrys courageous border agents thank you allwhen i learned that the tennessee valley authority laid off hundreds of american workers and forced them to train their lowerpaid foreign replacements i promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented american workers have been rehired and are back providing power to georgia alabama tennessee kentucky mississippi north carolina and virginia they have their old jobs back and some are here with us this evening please standlast month i took on big pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed the decades longawaited right to try legislation we also passed va accountability and va choiceby the end of my first term we will have approved more than 300 federal judges including two great new supreme court justices to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones the longterm funding of historically black colleges and universities and before the china virus came in produced the best unemployment numbers for africanamericans hispanicamericans and asianamericans ever recorded i have done more for the africanamerican community than any president since abraham lincoln our first republican president i have done more in three years for the black community than joe biden has done in 47 years—and when im reelected the best is yet to come!when i took office the middle east was in total chaos isis was rampaging iran was on the rise and the war in afghanistan had no end in sight i withdrew from the terrible onesided iran nuclear deal unlike many presidents before me i kept my promise recognized israels true capital and moved our embassy to jerusalem but not only did we talk about it as a future site we got it built rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned we took an already owned existing building in a better location and opened it at a cost of less than $500000 we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and this month we achieved the first middle east peace deal in 25 years in addition we obliterated 100 percent of the isis caliphate and killed its founder and leader abu bakr albaghdadi then in a separate operation we eliminated the worlds number one terrorist qasem soleimaniunlike previous administrations i have kept america out of new wars – and our troops are coming home we have spent nearly $25 trillion on completely rebuilding our military which was very badly depleted when i took office this includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors we also launched the space force the first new branch of the united states military since the air force was created almost 75 years agowe have spent the last four years reversing the damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 yearsbidens record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime he has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history biden voted for the nafta disaster the single worst trade deal ever enacted he supported chinas entry into the world trade organization one of the greatest economic disasters of all time after those biden calamities the united states lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs the laid off workers in michigan ohio new hampshire pennsylvania and many other states didnt want joe bidens hollow words of empathy they wanted their jobs back!as vice president he supported the trans pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for the us auto industry he backed the horrendous south korea trade deal which took many jobs from our country he repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed killing soleimani he oversaw the rise of isis and cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world thats why china supports joe biden and desperately wants him to winchina would own our country if joe biden got elected unlike biden i will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they causedin recent months our nation and the rest of the world has been hit with a onceinacentury pandemic that china allowed to spread around the globe we are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders – please stand and accept our profound thanks many americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease as one nation we mourn we grieve and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken in their honor we will unite in their memory we will overcomewhen the china virus hit we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii invoking the defense production act we produced the worlds largest supply of ventilators not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator we shipped hundreds of millions of masks gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers to protect our nations seniors we rushed supplies testing kits and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities the army corps of engineers built field hospitals and the navy deployed our great hospital shipswe developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system in the world america has tested more than every country in europe put together and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined we have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nationwe developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma that will save thousands of lives thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since aprilthe united states has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world the european unions case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours altogether the nations of europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the united stateswe enacted the largest package of financial relief in american history thanks to our paycheck protection program we have saved or supported more than 50 million american jobs as a result we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation and we are recovering much faster over the past three months we have gained over 9 million jobs a new recordunfortunately from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize when i took bold action to issue a travel ban on china joe biden called it hysterical and xenophobic if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have diedinstead of following the science joe biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country his shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nations children families and citizens of all backgroundsthe cost of the biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses depression alcohol addiction suicides heart attacks economic devastation and more joe bidens plan is not a solution to the virus but rather a surrendermy administration has a different approach to save as many lives as possible we are focusing on the science the facts and the data we are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk – especially the elderly – while allowing lowerrisk americans to safely return to work and schoolmost importantly we are marshalling americas scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time under operation warp speed we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now years ahead of what has been achieved before we are producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly availablewe will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virusat the democrat convention you barely heard a word about their agenda but thats not because they dont have one its because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee joe biden may claim he is an ally of the light but when it comes to his agenda biden wants to keep you completely in the darkhe has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all american families which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets on the other hand just as i did in my first term i will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads not raise them we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of china back to america – and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves america to produce jobs overseas well make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as ive already been doing joe bidens agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usabiden has promised to abolish the production of american oil coal shale and natural gas – laying waste to the economies of pennsylvania ohio texas north dakota oklahoma colorado and new mexico millions of jobs will be lost and energy prices will soar these same policies led to crippling power outages in california just last week how can joe biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party cant even keep the lights on?joe bidens campaign has even published a 110page policy platform coauthored with farleft senator bernie sanders the bidenbernie manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens implementing nationwide catchandrelease and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayerfunded lawyers joe biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants he also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens he promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent the biden plan would eliminate americas borders in the middle of a global pandemicbiden also vowed to oppose school choice and close down charter schools ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and hispanic childrenin a second term i will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in america and we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deservejoe biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable – yet the party he leads supports the extreme lateterm abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth democrat leaders talk about moral decency but they have no problem with stopping a babys beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancydemocrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving americas soul? tonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a godgiven right to lifeduring the democrat convention the words under god were removed from the pledge of allegiance – not once but twice the fact is this is where they are coming fromif the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedomsbiden is a trojan horse for socialism if joe biden doesnt have the strength to stand up to wildeyed marxists like bernie sanders and his fellow radicals then how is he ever going to stand up for you?the most dangerous aspect of the biden platform is the attack on public safety the bidenbernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail immediately releasing 400000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoodswhen asked if he supports cutting police funding joe biden replied yes absolutely when congresswoman ilhan omar called the minneapolis police department a cancer that is rotten to the root biden wouldnt disavow her support and reject her endorsement – he proudly displayed it on his websitemake no mistake if you give power to joe biden the radical left will defund police departments all across america they will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide they will make every city look like democratrun portland oregon no one will be safe in bidens americamy administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement every day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of dutyone of these incredible americans was detective miosotis familia she was part of a team of american heroes called the nypd or new yorks finest three years ago on fourth of july weekend detective familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badgedetective familia was a single mom – shed recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids two years ago i stood in front of the us capitol alongside those children and held their grandmothers hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored detective familias extraordinary lifedetective familias three children are with us this evening genesis peter and delilah we are so grateful to have you here tonight i promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories foreverwe must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble courageous and honorable we have to give law enforcement our police back their power they are afraid to act they are afraid to lose their pension they are afraid to lose their jobs and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs and those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protectwhen there is police misconduct the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable and it will but what we can never have in america – and must never allow – is mob rule in the strongest possible terms the republican party condemns the rioting looting arson and violence we have seen in democratrun cities like kenosha minneapolis portland chicago and new yorkthere is violence and danger in the streets of many democratrun cities throughout america this problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to we must always have law and order all federal crimes are being investigated prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the lawwhen the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments i signed an order ten years in prison and it all stoppedduring their convention joe biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in democratrun cities in the face of leftwing anarchy and mayhem in minneapolis chicago and other cities joe bidens campaign did not condemn it – they donated to it at least 13 members of joe bidens campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals arsonists looters and rioters from jailhere tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain david dorn a 38year veteran of the st louis police department in june captain dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters we are honored to be joined tonight by his wife ann and beloved family members: brian and kielen to each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of captain david dornas long as i am president i will defend the absolute right of every american citizen to live in security dignity and peaceif the democrat party wants to stand with anarchists agitators rioters looters and flagburners that is up to them but i as your president will not be a part of it the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safelast year over 1000 africanamericans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four democratrun cities the top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by democrats and have been for decades thousands more africanamericans are victims of violent crime in these communities joe biden and the left ignore these american victims i never willif the radical left takes power they will apply their disastrous policies to every city town and suburb in americajust imagine if the socalled peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the us governmentliberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of american institutions but who exactly is attacking them? who is hiring the radical professors judges and prosecutors? who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? in every case the attacks on american institutions are being waged by the radical leftalways remember: they are coming after me because i am fighting for youwe must reclaim our independence from the lefts repressive mandates americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases and the evermore restrictive political decrees many things have a different name now and the rules are constantly changing the goal of cancel culture is to make decent americans live in fear of being fired expelled shamed humiliated and driven from society as we know it the farleft wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be truebut on november 3rd you can send them a thundering message they will never forget!joe biden is weak he takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage these same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land they want to open our borders while living in walledoff compounds and communities they want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselvesthis november we must turn the page forever on this failed political class the fact is im here and theyre not – and thats
