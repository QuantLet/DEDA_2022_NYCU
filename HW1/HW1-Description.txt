Hi everyone,

Professor HÃ¤rdle showed how to draw a cute elephant in class today. 

For assignment 1: 
1. you need to draw any animals via python. You can adjust any code or parameter in the example. You can refer to handout Unit1 p.28~44 if you have no idea.
2. remember to also upload the video (mp4)/animation of the animal you draw.


As for uploading Homework, please upload your homework on Github(the file named "DEDA_2022_NYCU"), not on E3. Remember to read handout-QuantLet carefully before handing your homework. TA Jane will upload an instruction video later on E3.

Extra points for Homework: If you are willing to present your code and share any idea with us in the next class(Professor will ask if anyone wants to share with), you will get extra 5 points in the homework grading.



Feel free to ask if you have any questions:)

Hope you have an interesting learning journey on Python



TA Zoe
